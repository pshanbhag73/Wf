To extract this conversation into a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation for presenting the "IncidentPulse" debugging tool and its UI wireframes, I’ll outline a structured slide deck that summarizes the key points, including the application’s purpose, the five options for visualizing app relationship status, and their detailed UI wireframes. Below, I’ll describe the content for each slide, organized to be clear, professional, and visually engaging for a technical audience (e.g., your team or stakeholders). Since I cannot generate the PPT file directly, I’ll provide a detailed blueprint for the slides, including text, bullet points, and suggestions for visuals. I’ll also include tips for creating the PPT using PowerPoint, Google Slides, or Canva, and offer to refine specific slides or provide additional content if needed.

Monitor system metrics (e.g., CPU, memory, latency).
Visualize relationship status between two apps.
Target Users: DevOps, SREs, incident response teams.
Visuals: Icon-based diagram showing URLs, IPs, metrics, and app connections (use icons from Flaticon or FontAwesome).
Notes: Keep text concise, use bullet points with icons, and add a screenshot placeholder for the final app (if available).
Slide 2: Project Requirements
Title: Key Requirements
Content:
Vanity URLs: Check resolution, response times, HTTP status codes.
Device IPs: Validate and query IPs of involved devices.
Metrics: Collect and display CPU, memory, network latency, error rates.
App Relationships: Monitor interactions (e.g., API calls, network connectivity) between two apps.
Additional Needs:
Real-time updates via WebSocket.
User-friendly dashboard with alerts.
Integration with existing tools (e.g., Prometheus, ELK).
Visuals: Flowchart showing data flow (URLs → IPs → Metrics → Relationships).

Slide 3: Technical Architecture
Title: Technical Stack
Content:
Backend: FastAPI (Python), PostgreSQL (metadata), TimescaleDB (metrics).
Frontend: React, Tailwind CSS, Chart.js (graphs), Cytoscape.js (dependency graphs).
Monitoring: Prometheus, Grafana, OpenTelemetry.
Deployment: Docker, Kubernetes, AWS/GCP.
Networking: Ping, requests for URL checks, ipaddress for IP validation.

Five proposed solutions to visualize relationship status between two apps:
API Health Dashboard: Tracks API status and latency.
Dependency Graph: Visualizes dependencies as a graph.
Log-Based Interaction Tracker: Shows interaction history from logs.
Network Ping Monitor: Monitors network connectivity.
Service Mesh Dashboard: Uses service mesh telemetry for microservices.
Goal: Provide real-time insights for debugging app interactions.
Visuals: Icons for each option (e.g., table for API, graph for dependency, timeline for logs).
Notes: Use a 2x3 grid layout for the five options, with one cell empty or for a summary.
Slide 5: Option 1 - API Health Dashboard

Features:
Status badge (Healthy/Unhealthy).
Table with App, URL, Status, Latency, Last Checked.
Latency trend graph (Chart.js).
Alerts for API failures.

Tips for Creating the PPT
PowerPoint:
Create a new presentation with a 16:9 aspect ratio.
Use a template (e.g., “Ion” or “Minimal”) for a modern look.
Insert shapes (rectangles, circles, arrows) for wireframes based on ASCII layouts.
Use SmartArt for diagrams (architecture, timeline).
Apply Tailwind-like colors: bg-gray-800 (#1F2937), bg-green-500 (#22C55E), bg-red-500 (#EF4444).
Export as PDF or PPTX.
Google Slides:
Similar process, use “Widescreen” layout.
Import icons from Google’s Material Icons.
Use rectangles and text boxes for wireframes.
Share link for collaboration.
Canva:
Choose a “Presentation” template with a tech theme.
Drag-and-drop rectangles, circles, and text for wireframes.
Use Canva’s chart tools for graphs and tables.
Download as PPTX or PDF.
Visuals:
Source icons from Flaticon, FontAwesome, or PowerPoint’s built-in icons.
Use placeholder screenshots (e.g., generic dashboards) until the app is built.
Create wireframes in Figma, export as PNG, and insert into slides.
Time Estimate:
Creating 13 slides: ~4-6 hours in PowerPoint/Google Slides.
Adding wireframes: ~1 hour per slide in Figma or PowerPoint shapes.

Wireframe Visuals: To create wireframe images:
Use Figma: Draw rectangles, circles, and text based on ASCII layouts.
Use PowerPoint: Insert shapes and text boxes, group them for each wireframe.
Example: For Option 1, draw a circle (badge), table (grid), and line chart (SmartArt).
Animation: Add subtle slide transitions (e.g., Fade) and animate wireframe components (e.g., Appear) for emphasis.
Export: Save as PPTX for editing, PDF for sharing, or PNG for individual slides.
Next Steps
Refine Slides: Want me to provide detailed text for another specific slide or adjust the structure (e.g., add a demo slide)?
Code for Wireframes: Need a React component for a specific wireframe to prototype and screenshot?
Design Tools: Want a step-by-step guide for creating wireframes in Figma or PowerPoint?
