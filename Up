To build an application for debugging major incidents, focusing on checking vanity URLs, device IPs, and metrics, you’ll need a structured approach that ensures reliability, real-time monitoring, and ease of use for your team. Below is a concise plan to guide you:

1. Define Requirements

Vanity URLs: Check if URLs are resolving correctly, their response times, and HTTP status codes (e.g., 200, 404, 503).



Device IPs: Identify and validate IP addresses of devices involved in the incident (e.g., servers, clients, or network devices).



Metrics: Collect and display system metrics like CPU usage, memory, network latency, error rates, or application-specific KPIs.



Additional Features:

Real-time updates and alerts.



Historical data for post-incident analysis.



User-friendly dashboard for team collaboration.



Logging for audit trails.


2. Choose Tech Stack

Backend:

Language: Python (Flask/FastAPI) or Node.js for rapid development and scalability.



Framework: FastAPI for async support and real-time monitoring APIs.



Database: 

TimescaleDB or InfluxDB for time-series metrics.



PostgreSQL for storing device IPs and URL metadata.


Frontend:

React or Vue.js for a responsive dashboard.



Chart.js or D3.js for visualizing metrics.


Monitoring Tools:

Prometheus for collecting metrics.



Grafana for visualization (optional integration).



Pingdom or a custom script for URL status checks.


Networking:

socket or ipaddress (Python) for IP validation.



curl or requests for URL checks.


Deployment:

Docker for containerization.



Kubernetes for orchestration (if scaling is needed).



AWS/GCP/Azure for hosting.


3. Core Features Implementation

a. Vanity URL Checker

Functionality:

Send HTTP requests to vanity URLs using requests (Python) or axios (Node.js).



Check status codes, response times, and DNS resolution.



Handle redirects and SSL certificate issues.


Example (Python with FastAPI):

python


from fastapi import FastAPI
import requests
import asyncio

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/check-url/{url:path}")
async def check_url(url: str):
    try:
        response = requests.get(url, timeout=5)
        return {
            "url": url,
            "status_code": response.status_code,
            "response_time_ms": response.elapsed.total_seconds() * 1000,
            "is_up": response.status_code == 200
        }
    except requests.RequestException as e:
        return {"url": url, "error": str(e), "is_up": False}


Alerting: Notify team via Slack/Email if a URL is down (status ≠ 200).


b. Device IP Management

Functionality:

Store and query device IPs in a database.



Validate IPs using regex or libraries like ipaddress.



Provide an API to fetch IPs for specific devices or services.


Example (Python):

python


from ipaddress import ip_address
from fastapi import HTTPException

@app.get("/validate-ip/{ip}")
async def validate_ip(ip: str):
    try:
        ip_address(ip)
        return {"ip": ip, "valid": True}
    except ValueError:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=400, detail="Invalid IP address")


Integration: Cross-reference IPs with network logs or monitoring tools like Zabbix.


c. Metrics Collection

Functionality:

Collect metrics from servers/devices using Prometheus exporters or custom agents.



Store in a time-series database.



Expose metrics via API and visualize on a dashboard.


Example (Prometheus + Python):

python


from prometheus_client import Counter, generate_latest
from fastapi import Response

incident_errors = Counter("incident_errors_total", "Total errors during incidents")

@app.get("/metrics")
async def get_metrics():
    # Increment counter on error detection
    incident_errors.inc()
    return Response(content=generate_latest(), media_type="text/plain")


Visualization: Use Grafana or a custom React dashboard with Chart.js to display CPU, memory, or error rate trends.


4. Dashboard Design

Components:

URL Status Table: Show URL, status code, response time, and last checked time.



Device IP List: Display devices with their IPs and validation status.



Metrics Graphs: Real-time charts for CPU, memory, network, etc.



Incident Log: Timeline of actions taken during debugging.


Tools: Use Tailwind CSS for quick UI styling and WebSocket for real-time updates.


5. Additional Considerations

Scalability: Use async APIs and caching (Redis) for high-traffic scenarios.



Security:

Authenticate users with OAuth2 or JWT.



Restrict access to sensitive APIs (e.g., IP queries).



Encrypt sensitive data like IPs in the database.


Reliability:

Implement retry mechanisms for URL checks.



Use circuit breakers for external API calls.


Logging: Store all actions (URL checks, IP queries) in a log database or file for auditing.


6. Deployment

Containerize the app with Docker:

dockerfile


FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
COPY . .
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]


Deploy on AWS ECS or GCP Cloud Run for scalability.



Set up CI/CD with GitHub Actions for automated testing and deployment.


7. Testing

Write unit tests for URL and IP validation logic using pytest.



Simulate incidents to test dashboard functionality.



Load test with tools like Locust to ensure the app handles concurrent users.


8. Next Steps

Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) focusing on URL checks and a simple dashboard.



Iterate based on team feedback, adding IP management and metrics gradually.



Integrate with existing monitoring tools (if any) to avoid duplication.


If you share more details (e.g., preferred programming language, existing tools, or scale of the team), I can tailor the solution further or provide more specific code snippets. Would you like me to dive deeper into any part, like a specific API or dashboard design?
