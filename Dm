Step 3: Rate Relationships (Confidence Scoring)

Assign a confidence score to each matched relationship based on:

Number of Sources: More sources confirming the relationship increase confidence.



Source Reliability: Assign weights to sources based on their trustworthiness (e.g., CMDB = 0.8, Logs = 0.5).



Recency: Recent last_seen timestamps indicate active relationships.



Consistency: Agreement on details (e.g., same connection_type or metadata).


Scoring Formula:


Confidence = (Sum of Source Weights) * Recency Factor * Consistency Factor



Source Weight: Predefined weight for each source (e.g., CMDB = 0.8, API Gateway = 0.7, Logs = 0.5).



Recency Factor:

If last_seen is within 30 days: 1.0



30â€“90 days: 0.8



Older than 90 days: 0.5


Consistency Factor:

1.0 if all records in the cluster agree on connection_type and key metadata.



Reduce by 0.1 for each conflicting field (e.g., different connection_type).


Maximum Score: Normalize to 100.
