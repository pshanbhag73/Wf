The new formula becomes:


Source Contribution = Source Weight × Source Recency Factor × Source Consistency Factor
Total Raw Confidence = (Sum of Source Contributions) × (1 + 0.1 × (Number of Sources - 1))
Final Confidence = min(Total Raw Confidence × 100, 100)



Source Weight: The predefined weight for the source (e.g., 0.5 for all sources, as specified).



Source Recency Factor: Computed based on the last_seen timestamp of that source’s record (e.g., 1.0 if <7 days, 0.8 if 7–30 days, etc.).



Source Consistency Factor: Computed based on how well the source’s connection_type aligns with the most common connection_type in the cluster (e.g., 1.0 if it matches, 0.7 if it doesn’t).



Sources Bonus: (1 + 0.1 × (Number of Sources - 1)) remains to reward having more sources.


Steps to Compute Per-Source Factors

Per-Source Recency:

For each record, compute the recency factor based on its last_seen timestamp.



Use the same thresholds: 1.0 (<7 days), 0.8 (7–30 days), 0.5 (30–90 days), 0.2 (>90 days).


Per-Source Consistency:

Determine the most common connection_type in the cluster (e.g., if 2 sources report "API" and 1 reports "DB", "API" is the majority).



For each source:

If its connection_type matches the majority, assign a consistency factor of 1.0.



If it disagrees, assign a consistency factor of 0.7.


For a single source, the consistency factor is always 1.0 (no conflict possible).


Combine Contributions:

For each source, compute its contribution as Weight × Recency × Consistency.



Sum the contributions across all sources.



Apply the sources bonus and scale to 0–100.
