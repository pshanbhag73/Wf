Without the URL Tracker, the teams scramble across tools. The app dynamics team dives into APM dashboards – "No CPU spikes, but response times are high." The database folks check MongoDB logs – "Queries are fine, no replication lag." DevOps runs traceroutes from their laptops – but everyone's in the same office, so it's just one location. "Looks fine from here," one says. Another pulls Splunk logs – "No obvious errors." A third tries DNS lookup on their phone – "Resolves, but slow." It's chaos: manual commands in terminals, screenshots shared in Slack, and guesses about whether it's a regional outage or a global one. By 3 PM, they're chasing false leads – is it AWS routing? ISP problems? Customer-side firewalls? The platform teams are checking everywhere, from App Dynamics metrics to MongoDB health checks, but no one has a unified view of the network path.
